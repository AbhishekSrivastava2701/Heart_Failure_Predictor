#**Heart Failure Prediction Project**

#**Overview**
This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart failure using machine learning. It involves the use of Python, Flask, HTML, and CSS to create a web-based prediction tool. The machine learning model is trained on a heart failure dataset to make accurate predictions.

#**Data Source**
The dataset used for this project contains various features related to heart health, such as age, ejection fraction, serum creatinine, and more. The data was preprocessed and cleaned to prepare it for modeling.

#**Model Building**
The machine learning model used for heart failure prediction is based on [insert model name here]. It was trained on the preprocessed data to accurately predict the likelihood of heart failure.

#**Web Application**
The prediction model is integrated into a web application using Flask, HTML, and CSS. The user interface allows users to input their health information and receive a prediction regarding their likelihood of experiencing heart failure.

#**Dependencies**
To run this project, you will need to install the required dependencies, including Python, Flask, and any additional libraries used for model building and web development.

#**Usage**
To use the heart failure prediction tool, follow these steps:

1.Clone the repository to your local machine.
2.Install the required dependencies using pip or conda.
3.Run the Flask application to start the web server.
4.Access the web application through your browser and input the required health information.
5.Receive the prediction regarding your likelihood of heart failure.
